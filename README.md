# Image-Processing-with-MATLAB
A repository containing Image Processing programs using MATLAB, written to fulfill assignment requirements in the NUS module EE4704 Image Processing. This collection of functions are particularly beneficial to anyone looking to utilise this powerful tool to process images at scale. 

## CA1 Processing Techniques

- Histogram Equalisation (CA1_Program.m)
- Histogram Specification (CA1_Program.m)
- Transformation using the Formula (CA1_Program.m):

```
T: s_k = a(r_k + b)
```

## CA2 Processing Techniques

- Intermeans Algorithm (intermeans.m)
- Extracting Image Features (features.m)
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Compactness
  - Centroid
  - First Invariant Moment, ùúô1
- Edge Map (run_C.m)
- Hough Transform (run_C.m)
- Boundary Plot (rthetha.m, run_D.m)
